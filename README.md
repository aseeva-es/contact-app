This is my implementation of the folowing interview assignment https://github.com/aseevia/contacts-app-frontend. I decided to go with Next.js + Tailwind, just because I wanted to strengthen my knowledge of those frameworks. I drew design inspiration  from the following BeHance mockup https://www.behance.net/gallery/119373967/Contacts-UIUX-App-Redesign.

## Running the project locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Live Demo
Live demo of the application can be found here.
